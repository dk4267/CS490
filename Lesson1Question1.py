"""
Differences between Python 2 and Python 3:

1. Python 2 is no longer being maintained, while Python 3 is.
2. Python 3 is gradually starting to replace Python 2. Python 2 is mostly used for legacy code written in that version.
3. A lot of modern libraries are written only for Python 3, and Python 2 libraries are not forwards-compatible.
4. In Python 2, strings are stored as ASCII by default, and in Python 3, they are stored as Unicode by default.
    Unicode is more versatile than ASCII and includes more special characters.
5. In Python 2, integer division returns an integer rounded to the nearest whole number. In Python 3, integer division
    returns a decimal number if applicable.
6. Python 2 uses a print statement, while Python 3 uses a print() function.
